At experiment 4, plate 4 something apparently went wrong and
you re-started the analysis for that plate because the timing is different for that plate.

Usually at experiments, all the plates ave same hour savings so we differentiate them from their analysis ID.
At Experiment 4, plate 1,2 and 3 are same. But Plate 4 has different time savings. Be aware.

For more information about the time savings of the experiments, see TimeInformationForEveryExperiment.txt file.
